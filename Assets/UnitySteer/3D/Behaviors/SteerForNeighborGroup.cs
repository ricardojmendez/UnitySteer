    /// aggregation of the force vectors of each of the SteerForNeigbhors descendants
    /// that are attached to the game object. These *are* affected by the

    /// Previous versions of SteerFor Neighbors used to take into account separate
    /// values for filtering if a boid was an neighbor or not, which added flexibility
    /// but had the downside that we needed to evaluate the distance and alignment 
    /// of every potential neighbor as many times as we had neighbor-related 
    /// behaviors.
    /// 
    /// The current implementation only takes one set of neighbor-filtering values
    /// and applies them on detection to other vehicles in order to filter them
    /// before passing them to the attached SteerForNeighbor behaviors for them
    /// to calculate the contribution for each - on a typical boid scenario, it 
    /// cuts the checks down to a third.
